# Automatic Time Tracker for VS Code

Automatic Time Tracker is a Visual Studio Code extension that tracks the time you spend coding per workspace. It works silently in the background, automatically switching between projects and counting time only when VS Code is focused.

## Features

- Automatic time tracking for each workspace
- Status bar shows current workspace and tracked time
- Pauses when VS Code loses focus
- Persists time even when you close and reopen VS Code
- Fully automatic, no buttons or commands required

## Installation

1. Open the Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. Search for `Automatic Time Tracker` or `workspace-timer`.
3. Click **Install**.

## Usage

- Open any workspace or folder in VS Code.
- The extension will automatically start tracking time.
- Look at the status bar to see the current tracked time for the workspace.
- Time will pause automatically when VS Code is not focused and resume when you return.

## Extension Settings

This extension has no configurable settings; it runs fully automatically.
